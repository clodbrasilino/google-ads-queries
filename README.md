# google-ads-queries

Repository with queries that might be a helping hand when using Google Ads API.

It's a Maven project, you can import in any IDE you enjoy with maven support.

You need to provide Google Ads API credentials into a base.properties file in the root folder. You can see the path on the .gitignore file. The contents should be filled with these credentials:

api.googleads.refreshToken=
api.googleads.clientId=
api.googleads.clientSecret=
api.googleads.developerToken=
api.googleads.clientCustomerId=

Please check the Google Ads API documentation if you don't know how to obtain these.

All setup, you choose which query you want to run by running the main method in each of the classes.

This is a helping hand project, not full fledged one. Just sharing so that someone might need the same.

This code is provided AS IS and I give no support over it, nor I'm responsible for whatever you do with it.
